# Online Shop

Restfull APIs implemented using CQRS, EF, .Net Core 3.1 and hexagonal architecture. 

The application has the following functionalities:
- login and register
- CRUD for Categories
- CRUD for Products (each product should have a category)
- user cart (each user is able to add, edit and delete a product to/from their cart)

To ensure the code quality unit tests were written for the whole business logic.
